            <h2>Baby Turtles</h2>
            <p>
                Hands down the most unforgettable experience that 
                I had in Huatulco was getting to release baby sea 
                turtles into the ocean. Huatulco is known as a 
                major nesting zone for sea turtles, with local 
                conservation programs dedicated to protecting 
                these endangered creatures. Watching the little 
                guys make their way to the ocean was so heartwarming 
                as you get to witness the beginning of their 
                beautiful journey. If you're planning to visit and 
                experience it for yourself, it's important to 
                listen to your guides and only handle the hatchlings 
                with care, as it uses the energy that they need to 
                crawl their way across the beach.

            <h2>Beaches</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best things about Huatulco is how peaceful and authentic it feels compared to the more crowded destinations in Mexico. Huatulco is definitely a lesser known area, which means that the beaches were way less crowded than I'm used to. You're more likely to run into friendly locals than a crowd of other tourists. Exploring the coastline on a boat was definitely a highlight of my trip. We got to stop at multiple beaches, each with their own perfect charm, and spent lots of time snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters while soaking up the hot sun.

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>
                Huatulco's food scene was absolutely incredible, and I'm still dreaming about it to this day. The seafood was amazingly fresh, with each bite tasting like it came straight from the ocean to your plate in the best way possible. Huatulco also offers traditional Oaxacan specialties like mole and empanadas that gives you a taste into the regions heritage. Meals aside, the tropical drinks were amazing. Freshly made margaritas or aguas frescas really completed the experience. Whether we were enjoying food from a local vendor on the street, or fine dining at a beachfront restaurant, every meal was absolutely amazing and represents the best of Huatulco.
